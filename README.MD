### SVG PLANETS
A simple animation based on SVG, used for training on SVG files.
##### SVG files 
Files were created with InkScape, later revaluated as paths (easier to maintain and easier to animate). Most files are inline SVGs, one is external. The external "Skeleton" is a whole bunch of paths grouped together, so for code readability i left it outside the main file.
##### Animations
The idea was to learn SVG positioning and animating, so most of the important stuff is inside the style file.
##### JS
JS is mainly used for trigering animations.
